##  Overview
This project implements a **Neural Network model** to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous) using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset**.  
The model is designed to achieve **high accuracy (~95%)** while training efficiently (only **13 epochs** with EarlyStopping).  

The project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence** can be applied in the healthcare domain to assist doctors with **early detection and diagnosis**.

##  Features
- End-to-end workflow: Data cleaning → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation.  
- Uses **Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- Achieves **95% accuracy** in just **13 epochs**.  
- Generates **visualizations** (heatmap, histograms, class distribution).  
- Provides **confusion matrix and classification report** for evaluation.  
- Flexible and easy to extend (try new layers, optimizers, or other ML models).
